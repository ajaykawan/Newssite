Meanwhile, foreign investments of more than Rs five billion and up to Rs 10 billion must be approved by the Industrial Promotion Board, which is chaired by the industry minister. However, foreign investors will need permission from Investment Board Nepal to make investments of more than Rs 10 billion in Nepal.<br><br>\r\n\r\nâ€œThe long-awaited FITTA has been endorsed by the Cabinet and it will help to further strengthen the investment climate in the country,â€ said Minister for Industry Nabindra Raj Joshi, adding that the new act has introduced different provisions to promote foreign investment in Nepal. Joshi also said that availability of FITTA and different investment-friendly provisions incorporated within it will be crucial to materialise the foreign investment pledges that Nepal has received at present.<br><br>\r\nThe new draft bill of FITTA has not fixed any limit for foreign investment in Nepal. However, it has a provision thatv the government can fix upper limit of\r\nequity investment for service-oriented industries as per commitments made by Nepal after being a member of the World Trade Organisation.<br><br>\r\nMeanwhile, the new amendment bill of FITTA, for the first time, has welcomed foreign investment in the countryâ€™s secondary market. It has enabled foreign institutional investors and non-resident Nepali citizens to invest through the secondary market in Nepal, which is also called portfolio investment, by purchasing shares of those companies listed in the stock market.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe new FITTA has given Foreign Investment Promotion Board the responsibility to implement FITTA and other acts and rules regarding foreign investment in Nepal. It has identified hydroelectricity, transportation infrastructure, agriculture, tourism and aviation as priority sectors for foreign investment in Nepal and has restricted foreign investment in 13 different types of industries including traditional cottage industry, arms and ammunition, real estate, network and media, among others.<br><br>\r\nOn top of that, the new FITTA has mentioned it will treat foreign industries and investments and domestic industries equally in terms of different subsidy and tax waiver facilities. The FITTA has given income tax waiver facility to industries under FDI for up to five years after they begin production and  all forms of taxes have been waived off for the profit that foreign industries use to reinvest to enhance the industryâ€™s own capacity or in any other industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '149668500714.jpg', 'topnews', 1),

They had been confined there for two months and forced to have sex with customers. They said they had gone with the trafficker as he promised to take them to see the Taj.â€\r\n\r\nAlmost 46 million people are enslaved worldwide â€“ trafficked into brothels, forced into manual labour, victims of debt bondage or even born into servitude â€“ according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index.<br><br>\r\n\r\nForty percent, or more than 18 million, are in India. Many are from poor rural regions and lured with the promise of good jobs or marriage but end up sold into prostitution, domestic work, or industries such as brick kilns or textile units.<br><br>\r\n\r\nKant said interviews with the rescued girls suggested that using the Taj Mahal to lure victims was â€œan emerging trendâ€ employed by traffickers, who are constantly finding new ways to enslave people as public awareness of the crime spreads.<br><br>\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many initiatives in trafficking-prone areas such as public campaigns to inform people about human trafficking and how these traffickers operate,â€ said Kant.<br><br>\r\n\r\nâ€œBut these criminal gangs are also very clever and using new ways to cheat poor illiterate communities. We need to know about these methods and incorporate them into our public awareness work.â€<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe six girls, all aged between 17 and 19 and from villages in the impoverished district of South 24 Parganas on Indiaâ€™s eastern border with Bangladesh, were reported missing in March, said Kant.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey were initially taken to Delhi where they were kept in a small flat for six days and then transported to Agra in Uttar Pradesh state â€“ 230 km (140 miles) from the capital â€“ where they were sold to a brothel, he added.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne of girls had managed to phone her family and police traced the mobile phone to Agra. They raided the brothel on Thursday and found the girls hidden in a secret bunker under a bed in one of the rooms. Two of the girls are pregnant.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere were also nine other victims in the brothel.<br>\r\n\r\nThe victims have been reunited with their families, said Kant, adding that the priority was to ensure they were given medical and psychological support. The brothel owner, a 24-year-old woman, has been arrested. Police are still looking for the traffickers, added Kant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '149685130514.jpg', 'topnews', 1),
